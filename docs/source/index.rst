|package-name|
==============

|Package-name| is a |Sphinx| extension
which enables compilation of |SASS| and SCSS files to CSS
when generating documentation for HTML output.

Installation
------------

|Package-name| is compatible with |Python| versions >=3.5 and |Sphinx| >=1.8.

To install |package-name| use:

.. code:: bash

   pip install sphinx-sass

Usage
-----

There are two ways that |package-name| can be configured:

Configuration from ``conf.py``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To configure the extension from ``conf.py``
use the ``sass_configs`` variable.
This is a list of dictionaries,
where each dictionary is a separate configuration.

.. code:: python

    sass_configs = [
        dict=(
           # Configuration options.
        )
    ]

For configuration options, see `Configuration options`_ below.

Configuration from an extension
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use |package-name| in an extension,
it is necessary to connect to the ``config-inited``
event (note this only available from Sphinx v1.8):

.. code::

    def setup(app):
       app.setup_extension('sphinx-sass')
       app.connect('config-inited', init)

    def init(app, config):
       config.sass_compile_configs['custom-config'] = dict(
          # Configuration options.
       )

The configuration is the same as when used
in ``conf.py``, except that the
``entry`` path should be an absolute path.

Configuration options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``entry``
   The path to the main SASS/SCSS file which whil be the
   entry point for the SASS compile.
   This may be relative to the directory
   containing the Sphinx ``conf.py`` file,
   or an absoulte path.

``output``
   The path (including the filename) to the resulting CSS file.
   This should be relative to the first entry
   specified in ``html_static_path``

``compile_options``
   Options passed to the |sass.compile| function from |libsass|.
   The ``string``, ``filename`` and ``directory`` options
   are ignored
   (internally |package-name| uses the ``filename`` option).

   Note that correctly configuring an external source map
   can be a little unintuitive, so a convenience
   ``source_map`` option (described below)
   can be used if external source maps are required.

``add_css_file``
   By default, the extension will automatically tell Sphinx to add a
   link to the compiled CSS file. If this is not wanted
   (e.g., if the CSS file is specified in a template),
   then adding this key and setting it to ``False`` will not
   add the link.

``source_map``
   A convenience option for automatically setting the SASS ``compile_options``
   for source maps. Setting this option to the value ``embed``
   will generate embedded source maps.
   Using the value ``file`` will generate an external source map
   in the same directory as the CSS file specified with
   the ``output`` option, using the CSS filename suffixed
   with ``.map``
   (so the source map ``main.css`` will be called ``main.css.map``).

Passing variables to the SASS compiler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In rare cases, it may be desirable to pass
variables from ``conf.py`` (or an extension initialisation function)
to the SASS compiler. This can be achieved using
|importer callbacks|.

For example, given the entry point ``main.scss``:

.. code-block:: scss2

   @import "abstract";
   $headline: red !default;
   h1 {
      color: $headline;
   }


A custom importer can be defined which will be called whenever
the compiler encouters the ``@import`` statement:

.. code:: python

   def abstract_importer(path, prev):
       if path == 'abstract':
          return (path, '$headline: blue;')
       # Handled by other importers, or by default libsass behaviour
       return None

This can be added to the compile options using the
``importers`` option:

.. code:: python

   compile_options = dict(
      importers=[(0, abstract_importer)]
   )

Where the first value in the tuple represents the
relative priority of the custom importer.
When compiled, the return value of the ``abstract_importer``
will be imported. Note, in some cases this may result in
external source maps generating incorrect line numbers.

Notes
~~~~~

- |Package-name| uses the first entry in the configuration variable ``html_static_path``, if it exists.
- Compiled CSS files are written directly to the build directory just before Sphinx exits (during the ``build-finished``) event.
- |Package-name| is pre-alpha. It should just work as is, but bugs are likely and anything or everything may change with absolutely no warning.

Acknowledgements
----------------

This extension makes use of the
rather excellent |libsass| package.
